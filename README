DESCRIPTION:

This plugin enables the ability to replace an installed package, with another
package that provides the same thing.  It was developed specifically for the
IUS Community Project whose packages have alternative names as to not
automatically upgrade stock packages.  They also do not Obsolete the packages
they provide, therefore making upgrading a little bit more tedious.  For
example upgrading 'mysql' to 'mysql50' or 'mysql51' requires first
uninstalling 'mysql' and then installing the alternate package name.  An
alternative is using the yum shell allowing you do uninstall, and install
packages in one operation.

This plugin allows the end user to replace a package with another in the
following fashion:

    $ yum replace mysql --replace-with mysql51


The plugin first determines what 'mysql' (or the original package) provides
and then verifies that the alternative package (mysql51) also provides the
same.  It continues to determine what other sub-packages of 'mysql' are
installed and then determines the replacement package from the 'mysql51'
set, also ensuring that the new package has the same 'provides'.

If a package does not meet the 'providers' requirements the process with
halt and ask for user approval to continue.  Then end user can optionally
pass '-y' to assume yes to this inquiry.  It should be noted that it is 
quite common that a newer 'replacement' package would not fully provide
everything that the original package did.
